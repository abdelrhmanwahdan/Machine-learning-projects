If you have a mobile company this project will make your life a lot easier. I know that when you try to sell your phones one of the most annoying things is what is the price tag that you should put in each smartphone. Nowadays with this huge numbers of smartphones with different specifications it must be really overwhelming. In this project I am going try to help you solve this problem by using different smart phones prices that we already know. I will try to help you in putting the right price tag on different smart phones to maximize your profits.
